I loved going to Indo for the first time to experience my culture and heritage
I loved going to Singapore both times to get closer to my family and loved ones
I went to San Francisco with my boo thang Brenda. I loved it and I love her
I cannot wait to get mod 1 prework done so I can go to NYC with Brenda
